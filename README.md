# Data Drop

This project is the Data Velocity Interactive for the CS Field Guide and UDEL CISC374. After playing this interactive, and reading the CS Field Guide, a user should infer the limits to processing data at high speeds for a single processor and will see an example consequence of having data exceed this limit.
